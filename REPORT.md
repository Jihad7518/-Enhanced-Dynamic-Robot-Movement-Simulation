Pathfinding Robot Simulation Project Report
Overview
The Pathfinding Robot Simulation project involves creating a simulation of a robot navigating through a grid environment to reach its goal. The simulation includes two search algorithms: Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A*. The primary goal of this project is to showcase the implementation of these search algorithms in a robotics context for optimal pathfinding.

Design
Grid Environment
The grid environment is represented as a 2D array where obstacles are denoted by '1' and free spaces by '0'. The robot is tasked with finding the optimal path from the starting position to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

Search Algorithms
Uniform Cost Search (UCS):

UCS explores the search space by considering the cost of each step uniformly. The priority queue ensures that paths with lower costs are explored first.
A Search:*

A* incorporates a heuristic function to guide the search. It balances the cost of reaching a node (g-cost) with the estimated cost from that node to the goal (h-cost), prioritizing paths with lower total costs.
Challenges and Solutions
Battery Management
One challenge was efficiently managing the robot's battery level. The implemented solution includes a battery recharge mechanism triggered when the battery falls below a certain threshold.

Visualization
Creating an effective visualization of the simulation results posed another challenge. The visualization function was enhanced to clearly display the grid, robot path, and relevant positions.

Observations
The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both UCS and A* in finding optimal paths. The recharge mechanism ensures the robot's ability to complete the task even in challenging environments.

Future Improvements
Explore additional heuristic functions for A* to further optimize pathfinding.
Implement dynamic obstacle avoidance to handle real-time changes in the environment.
